<h1>Learnings from designing Battlezone VR</h1>
<br/>

<p>While at Rebellion Games, I worked on the VR reboot of Battlezone. We were working closely with Sony and had some of the first PlayStation VR  dev kits in the country. The project started in late 2015, so there were very few VR games around, and very little knowledge on the tech. Even Sony shrugged and looked awkward when we asked them for help with particular problems. In reality, they were looking to us to help solve those problems. 

Here are some of the things we learnt in developing the game and even some solutions.</p><br/><br/>

<h2>Problem: Feeling sick</h2>
<p>If you have ever played video games in VR, spoken to anyone who has, or been in the same room as VR kit, you will know one of the biggest problems is feeling nauseous while playing.  

People feel nauseous because their brain thinks they're moving when they're not. Playing a first-person shooter in VR, where your eyes are telling you you're tunning around, and your body is telling you you're sitting in a chair, causes that exact problem. Add in high movement speeds and low framerates, and you have a deadly mix for inducing seasickness.

As Battlezone is a first-person shooter, we had to solve this problem, or the project was a non-starter.</p><br/><br/>

<h2>Solution:  A cockpit</h2>
<p>Researching the few experiments in the market, it was clear that sitting the player in a cockpit helped reduce the feeling of nausea. A cockpit is helpful for several reasons. 

Firstly, if the player sits in a cockpit, the game scenario mirrors what they are doing in real life, sitting in a chair.  

Secondly, the cockpit helps give the player a point of reference for the movement. For example, strafing is one of the wost actions to do in VR. Making the cockpit move like a gyro around the player helps give context to the movement and reduced the motion sickness.

Reducing movement speed also helps a lot. You may be surprised how slow this movement is. When testing it on a 2D screen, it feels crazy slow, and your design director will be over your shoulder telling you to speed things up. Placing the player close to the ground and having a well-populated landscape will help to return the feeling of speed. 

We spent around three months working on the cockpit and movement to reduce the feeling of nausea.</p><br/><br/>

<h2>Problem: You need a butler</h2>
<p>If you want to test something in VR, you have to put the headset on, adjust it, find your headphones and put them on, then find the controller. If something isn't working correctly, you have to take it all off and start again. Often we had the person sat next to us put the headphones on us, pass the controller and wiggle a wire if something wasn't working. It was a pain in the ass.</p><br/><br/>

<h2>Solution: A big stuffed toy</h2>
<p>We brought a massive stuffed rabbit. Put all the gear on it, and sat it in front of the TV. We then routed the VR headset output to the TV. That way we could test quickly, what was being seen in-game by the player (or rabbit), saving us a lot of time and frustration each day.</p><br/><br/> 

<h2>Problem: It's uncanny</h2>
<p>Initially, we mounted the camera on a body that sat in the cockpit. We thought it would help with transitioning from the physical world, to VR and give the player physical presents in the game. The body didn't move, because we didn't have the tech to capture the player's movement. So instead, it made players feel detached and paralyzed.</p><br/><br/> 

<h2>Solution: Map real-world objects</h2> 
<p>Sony implemented a way to map the controller into the game. When the player was in VR, the game controller was floating in front of them in the place they were holding it. It rotated and moved as the player moved it and showed the buttons pressed. This gave the player some presents in the game and solved the problem of being able to find the controller when wearing the VR headset.</p><br/><br/> 

<h2>Advice: Don't aim with your face.</h2>
<p>Don't have the player aim by looking at something unless it's part of the game design. In a first-person shooter, the player may want to be shooting an enemy while looking around for cover or other enemies. If you're aiming is tied to where the player is looking, they can't do that. 

Having UI elements stuck to your face is a bit like having something stuck on your glasses. As mentioned above, with a cockpit pit set up, you can render elements to the windshield.</p><br/><br/>
