<h1>Feature creation for Candy Crush Friends</h1>
<br/><br/>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A sub-team of the Candy Crush Friends team were asked to create an event that increases Daily Active Users (DAU) and Game Rounds (the number of levels people play) over the holiday period.
As the UX/UI lead my job was to provide a framework for the design process. Then coach and mentor the designers enabling them to lead the process as part of a cross-functional team.<br/><br/>

The result was a successful event for the business, developed using a design process lead by designers. The designers on the team were more confident and gained trust from the rest of the group.</p><br/><br/>
    
<h2>What is an event</h2>
<p>For a limited time, players can complete unique levels or activities that are separate or related to their main progression in the game. If players complete all the tasks or levels in the event, they will receive in-game rewards.</p><br/><br/>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>I worked closely with the Designers and PO to build a set of steps and checkpoints with clear deliverables and ownership.</p><br/>

<ul>        
<li>Brief</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Team ideation</li>
<li>Refine and test</li>
<li>Gold, Silver and Bronze scope</li>
<li>Team kick-off</li>
<li>Flows and specs</li>
<li>Ship</li>
<li>Review</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>The team was asked to create an event that raised Daily Active Users (DAU) and Game Rounds (the number of levels people play) over the Christmas period. The event needed to run for a month so can't be too intensive or demanding for players and risk burn out.
It was important that players not only returned to the game but also played a level. Our hypothesis was if they play one level, we could set them up for success with rewards, and they would be more likely to stay in the game and play more levels. This would increase both our DAU and game rounds.<br/><br/>
        
I worked with the game designer and PO to create a brief. As there was a junior game designer on the team, I thought the team would get more value if they could learn so assigned the brief to them. I provided a template I developed. Here is the information I like to have before starting a piece of work.</p><br/>
        
<ul>
<li>What is the problem or opportunity?</li>
<li>How do we know it's a problem or an opportunity</li>
<li>Who are we solving it for?</li>
<li>Player goals- How do we want the player to feel?</li>
<li>Business goals - What do we want the players to do?</li>
<li>What KPI's are we tracking?</li>
<li>What's the Deadline?</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
        
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>One of the goals of the research phase is to ensure we don't reinvent the wheel. I encourage teams to look inside the company, across the games industry and outside the games industry to answer these questions.</p><br/>

<ul>
<li>Has anyone else solved this problem?</li>
<li>What similar mental models are there we can reference?</li>
<li>Are there any patterns or common language around this?</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<p>There are many examples of how other products encourage users to come back every day. But few required users to actively engage in the product. Most allowed the user to log in, collect a reward and leave each day.</p><br/><br/>

  <p><cite>"I have found using markers, and post-it notes level the playing field for those who aren't confident in their art skills."</cite><br/><br/>
    
<p>Once we have a brief and a research deck, we felt we could give the team enough context to have a meaningful ideation session. I worked with the game designer to plan a workshop for the cross-functional team.<br/><br/>
    
We discussed the ideas as a group, looking at them from the different perspectives of the crafts. We generated a range of opinions and evaluated them with the team based on technical feasibility and how well it solved the problem.<br/><br/>
        
The designer and I grouped the ideas that we similar. We synthesised the thinking down their simpler forms, removing any theming or metaphors so we could start to find functionality and build requirements.</p><br/><br/>

Having defined the high-level requirements, the art team started ideating on visualising the feature to the player.</p><br/><br/>

<p>We did two mapping exercises. The first was to understand how the experience would scale over the event. The second to allow them to capture how the screen would evolve.</p><br/><br/>

<h2>User Tests</h2>
<p>We worked with the Player Insights team to organise a series of focus groups to help us test the concept with players.
We wanted to understand if the players understood the concept and if it fits in their view of the game. We also wanted to talk to them about the motivations for playing and where this could fit in.<br/><br/>
    
We tested three options at the extreme ends of the scale of the idea. We wanted to get a sense of how far we could push the idea and what were the breaking points for players.
We found that players understood how the feature worked and felt it was an excellent addition to the game world, providing a different way of playing. Players had some concerns that we could overcome with good level balancing.<br/><br/>
        
Some of the team joined the sessions. For those that didn't, we presented the findings back to them in a show and tell.</p><br/><br/>

<p><cite>A section of the flow created in Overflow.</cite><br/><br/>

Taking the learnings from the user test and design instinct we worked up three designs breaking them down into a Bronze, silver, gold implementations.<br/><br/>

Bronze is the essential things that could make the feature effective. Gold was the full feature with all the polish. Silver is a good discussion point to help us understand what we really think is valuable.<br/><br/>
    
This is a valuable exercise to do with the team as teams start to understand what is possible for the different crafts. Something that design has put into Gold based on the assumption that it would be difficult from a dev perspective might turn out to be very simple and move into Bronze.<br/><br/>
        
Having found an option to move forwards with the designers built out the flows and specs.</p><br/><br/>

<p>The feature was one of the most successful in the game increasing player spending and prompting implementation in other King titles.</p><br/><br/>

<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>Don't start art so early - we fell in love with the solution causing us to nearly overrun.<br/><br/>

Find a smaller MVP - be braver and leaner. we're too concerned about what players expect without testing the level of expectations. This could mean we are putting in an unnecessary effort and therefore cost.</p><br/><br/>
