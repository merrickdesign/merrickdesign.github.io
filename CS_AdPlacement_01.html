<h1>Case Studie: Creating a new in-game ad placement</h1>
<br/>
    
<h2>What is an Ad placement</h2>
    <p>Ad placement is placing opportunities in the user flow to watch a video advert. Watching the Advert would benefit the player, for example, by gaining in-game currency or retrying a failed level.</p>
<br/><br/>

<h2>Team</h2>
<p>For this feature, I was working with one of the 5 small teams working on the project. This team included.
<ul>
<li>One PO/Producer</li>
<li>Two developers</li>
<li>One shared UI artist</li>
<li>One UX/UI lead (Me)</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
 
<h2>My role</h2>
<p>As the UX/UI lead on the project, I lead the UX/UI craft in creating principles, facilitating design culture and best practices, and mentor other designers. I work with product leads to identify opportunities and define the design process for cross-functional teams. I also work directly with teams; in this case, I was creating flows, wireframes, prototypes and specs.
<br/><br/>
    
<h2>Steps</h2>  
<ul>
<li>Define </li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Explore</li>
<li>Flows and prototype</li>
<li>Ship</li>
<li>Learn</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
        
<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>Our current ad placements in the game met feature parity across the King Games portfolio. The team wanted to know if adding a new placement was possible and if it would create more impact than optimising current placements.
<br/><br/>
There was a deadline of 4 weeks for this feature, and I was supporting several other teams. This was an excellent chance to prove the scalability of the design process.
<br/><br/>
To build a shared understanding of our goals, I sat down with the team to gather requirements and create a brief.
To build the brief I wanted to know
What are the business goals
Players goals or why would the player care
What KPI's are we tracking
What results would make us continue or not with this initiative</p>

<p>The goal of the research was to make sure we're not reinventing the wheel. Whenever I conduct research, I like to look into these areas.
<br/><br/>
Are there any industry standards for this feature?
How have others presented the mechanics and what metaphors did they use?
Is there a common language around this in games?
Is there anything we can learn from other industries?
How have others solved this problem?
<br/><br/>    
I walked the team through the mood board to make sure I hadn't missed any key ideas, references or insights, and to build context as we move forward.
We decided to explore adding a placement at the point the player wins a reward. This was something that seemed to be an industry standard that we were missing and was well suited to our game.</p>

<p>I checked in with the PO, UI artist and devs to get feedback on the explorations. We made a shortlist of ideas to investigate further by looking at how well they solved the problem, technical feasibility and technical effort. We also looked at whether any of these ideas could build on top of each other.<br/><br/>

We identified three solutions. Solution "a", an MVP, we could develop, test and publish in a few days by combining elements already in the game.<br/><br/>
        
Solution "b" required more exploration from art and a prototype to understand the flow better. We felt this was more exciting for the player and would increase engagement with the ad.
We felt solution "c" would be the most engaging and yield the most views but would require refactoring parts of the system.
Producing "a" or "b" would help us understand if players would engage with the ad, and if we should continue developing the feature.
Due to the short time frame, low cost, and the perceived low risk of the design, we decided to skip a user test.
We started building "a" knowing it was a safe bet, and a step towards solution "b".</p>

<p>Working from the sketches, the UI artist and I created a higher fidelity flow, mapping out where we needed new art. The UI artist mocked up possible art solutions, while I created some prototypes to explore flow and animation. We checked in with the devs and PO with a couple of directions to review landing on a solution that was possible for us to ship in the time.
Solution "C" prototype. Created in Origami.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h2>Ship it!</h2>
<p>We shipped solution "b" in time for the pre-Christmas period. In total it took three weeks, with only four days of UX and two days of UI. This allowed the UI designer and I to continue to support the team with little disruption.<br/><br/>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The feature performed better than we hoped, increasing ad revenue and enabling us to beat our targets for the year.</p>

<br/><br/>    
<h2>Learnings and conclusion</h2>
<p>We have continued with this model of finding low-risk optimisations or small features that require little work from UX or Art. This has led the team to deliver updates every 2–4 weeks that consistently provide an uplift in crucial areas.<br/><br/>

I learnt to be more flexible with the design process. It's ok to skip steps if you understand why and what the risks are in omitting these steps.</p>
